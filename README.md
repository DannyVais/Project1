# Project1
Employee Reimbursement
Co-op project made by Jordan Casavecchia and Daniel Vais.

The project workload was divided amongst ourselves with Jordan working on the Employee functionality and interface, and Daniel working on the Manager's functionality and interface. We each created identical databases and project structure so we could work on our halves of the project without creating any conflict when it came to merging the files together for a final product.

We used JDBC for our database connectivity to perform all functions of the web program.

Servlet classes are used for calling HTML pages with CSS styling and printing out information from the database. Due to time constraint, learning how to pull database information into HTML file td tags was not possible.
